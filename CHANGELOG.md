- [Issue #344](https://github.com/manheim/terraform-pipeline/issues/344) Add PLAN_ONLY parameter to PlanOnlyPlugin
  - **BREAKING CHANGE** This change is a breaking change. Prior to this update, applying the PlanOnlyPlugin would restrict the pipeline to only running `terraform plan`. This update changes behavior to simply providing a `PLAN_ONLY` boolean parameter that can be set to restrict the build behavior. It defaults to `false`.

- [Issue #365](https://github.com/manheim/terraform-pipeline/issues/365) Feature: Optionally configure flyway username/password through CLI options
- [Issue #362](https://github.com/manheim/terraform-pipeline/issues/362) Bug Fix: Apply AnsiColorPlugin on `terraform validate` and `terraform init`
- [Issue #368](https://github.com/manheim/terraform-pipeline/issues/368) Feature: FlywayMigrationPlugin - prompt user _again_ before applying migration. Optionally disable prompt.

  - The purpose of this, is to allow other Plugins to modify Environment variables. Some TerraformCommands may be affected by the Environment variables at the time in which plugins are applied (eg: S3BackendPlugin). Make sure that all possible environment variables are available at the time in which plugins are applied to the commands.

# v1.3

- Store the `env` variable for later use
- Allow pipeline users to provide a DEFAULT_NODE_NAME environment variable, rather than explicitly specifying it in the pipeline
